# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provied recommendations to the client on the most important factors of their kickstarter campaign to create the best chance of reaching the fundraising goal. Data from completed theater kickstarter campaigns is anlayzed to determine any trends in launch date and goal amount that could predict success or failure to raise funds.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I reviewed 1369 kickstarter campaigns within the Theater category. Of these, 37 were canceled, 493 failed, and 839 succesfully raised their goal amount. [(see here)](https://github.com/hkoivisto/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx) Plotting these results  based on the campaign launch date, we can see that campaigns launched in May and June have the highest rate of success. Campaigns launched from October through Decemeber have the highest rate of failure.

It is recommened that future kickstarter campaigns be launched between May and June to provide the best chance of reaching the fundraising goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I reviewed 1047 kickstarter campaingns under the subcategory 'plays.' Of these, 694 were successful, and 353 campaigns failed. I grouped these camaaigns by their fundraising goal amount to look for trends in success or failuer. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Though the analysis from Outcomes Based on Launch Date show clear trend of successful campaigns being launched in May and June, this anlaysis does not account for the duration of the campaign. This presents a challenge in determining if failed campaigns could have been successful if allowed to fundraise for an extended period of time.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
