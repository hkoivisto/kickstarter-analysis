# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Analyze completed theater kickstaer campaigns to determine any trends in date and goal amount that could predict success or failure to raise funds.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I reviewed 1369 kickstarter campaigns under teh Theater category. Of these, 37 were canceled, 493 failed,a nd 839 succesfully raised their goal amount. Plotting these results based on the campaign launch date, we can see that campaigns launch in May and June have the highest rate of success. Campaigns launch from October through Decemeber have the highest rate of failure.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I reviewed 1047 kickstarter campaingns under the subcategory 'plays.' Of these, 694 were successful, and 353 campaigns failed. I grouped these camaaigns by their fundraising goal amount to look for trends in success or failuer. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Though the analysis from Outcomes Based on Launch Date show clear trend of successful campaigns being launched in May and June, this anlaysis does not account for the duration of the campaign. This presents a challenge in determining if failed campaigns could have been successful if allowed to fundraise for an extended period of time.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
